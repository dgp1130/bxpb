# `@bxpb/runtime`

Implements the runtime for clients and services using
[Browser Extension Protocol Buffers (BXPB)](https://github.com/dgp1130/bxpb/packages/runtime/).

Note: All currently exported APIs from this package are considered "private" to BXPB generated code
and are not fit to be called directly by user code. In the future, publically avilable APIs may be
added here.
